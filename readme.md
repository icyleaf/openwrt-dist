## Openwrt Package Builder

### Usage
#### Step 1
First, Add the public key [simonsmh-dist.pub](./simonsmh-dist.pub) which is paired with private key [key-build](./key-build) for building.

```
wget http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/simonsmh/openwrt-dist@master/simonsmh-dist.pub
opkg-key add simonsmh-dist.pub
```

#### Step 2
You can get target branch from distfeeds on your router.

```
# cat /etc/opkg/distfeeds.conf
src/gz openwrt_core https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/21.02.0/targets/x86/64/packages
...
```

Here means _x86/64_ is your's target, you got **packages/_x86/64_** as **branch name** now.

#### Step 3
Search your branch name in the branches list and add the following line toÂ `/etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf`.

```
src/gz simonsmh http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/simonsmh/openwrt-dist@{{$BRANCH_NAME}}
```

For example, if you want to use `x86_64` packages and you got the branch name as `packages/x86/64`, You could use this line after the previous step.

```
src/gz simonsmh http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/simonsmh/openwrt-dist@packages/x86/64
```

Then install whatever you want.

```
opkg update
opkg install ChinaDNS
opkg install luci-app-chinadns
opkg install dns-forwarder
opkg install luci-app-dns-forwarder
opkg install shadowsocks-libev
opkg install luci-app-shadowsocks
opkg install v2ray-plugin
opkg install luci-app-pdnsd
opkg install v2ray-core
opkg install luci-app-v2ray
opkg install luci-app-vlmcsd
...
```

For more detail please check the manifest.

You can also search and install them in LuCI or upload these downloaded files to your router with SCP/SFTP, then login to your router and use opkg to install these ipk files.

## Openwrt Image Builder

Build configurable images with ImageBuilder after the SDK finished building packages. The images are stored in the device named branches, like *image/generic.x86_64*

[Reference for installation](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/generic.sysupgrade)

## Build it yourself
[Check here](https://github.com/simonsmh/openwrt-dist/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)

You need to make a fork and chage items in the matrix yourself to match your needs. If you need to keep your packages safe, please use `usign` to regenerate private key and make the repo private.
